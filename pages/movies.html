                <h2>Everything is illuminated</h2>
                <img src="../images/everythingisilluminated.jpg" alt="Scene from the movie: Everything is illuminated">
                <p>The main reason because i like this movie, is the presence of the singer Eugene Hutz, 
                    from the band Gogol Borderllo. He's a good singer, but also a good actor, and this 
                    particular tragic-comic movie is the proof of his ability.
